In this lab, I present 4 different coding languages with different programs for each language. 

For the c++ program, I created a simple code that displays "hello world" when ran. To compile code, enter "g++ <filename.cpp>" To run code, enter "./a.out" MUST HAVE g++ INSTALLED

The python program I created adds two numbers together by a given user input. To run code, simply enter "python <filename.py>" 

The ruby program asks the user for a name and responds with "Hello usrname!" To run code, simply enter "ruby <filename.rm>" 

The perl program counts down by a given user input. To run code, simply enter "perl <filename.pl>(number of seconds)" Example: perl "filename.pl20" 20 second countdown"
